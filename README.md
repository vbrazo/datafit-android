# DataFit Android app

DataFit was a side project that I was involved in last year, and I have decided to open source it so that I can add to my portfolio a prove that I know how to build an Android app written in Kotlin.

DataFit Android app is a mobile application written in Kotlin and this project contains the welcome views, sign up and sign in flows.
